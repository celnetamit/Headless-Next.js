Using GGBS slag to improve the CBR value of subgrade soil can have potential benefits. Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) are known to have various engineering applications, and their combined with EPE (Expanded Polythene Foam) use may slightly enhance the subgrade soil’s strength and stability. The study explored the effects of incorporating GGBS slag 20%, 25% &amp; 30% with clay soil and it is long-term performance in improving the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of the subgrade soil. The result indicates that a stabilization ratio of 75% clay soil and 25% GGBS is compatible with all desirable sub-grade requirements. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is an essential engineering measure used to evaluate the subgrade soil’s strength and its ability to support loads in construction projects. This thesis investigates the potential of utilizing Expanded Polythene Foam (EPE) and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) as stabilizing agents to improve the CBR value of subgrade soil. The research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these materials in enhancing the soil’s strength, deformation characteristics and long-term performance through laboratory experiments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Keywords:&nbsp;</strong>Prosocial, early childhood, android, object detection, etc</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>[This article belongs to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.stmjournals.com/joge\">Journal of Geotechnical Engineering&nbsp;</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to cite this article:</strong><br>Khusbo Satter Shoshe, Rakib Shahriar, Susmita Samonta, Md.
